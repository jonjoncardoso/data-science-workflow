# A Practical Workflow for Data Science Projects

This project is intended as a template structure for data science projects. Its main intended use is for teams within organizations but we see no reason why you would not benefit from it even if you are coding solo, participating in a data hackathon or are in an academic group, doing exploratory, statistical analysis or algorithm modelling.

This is a standalone **template project** that can be used as a starting point for any data science project. It is not a framework, a library, or a package. It is a template that you can use to start your own project. It is not intended to be a one-size-fits-all solution, but rather a starting point for you to build your own project structure.

# Set up

Follow the instructions below to make use of this template.

1. Create a new repository on GitHub using this template. You can do this by clicking on the green "Use this template" button on the top right of this page.

2. Give your project a name and description. You can also choose to make the repository **private** if you wish. 

3. GitHub will copy the files from this repository into your new repository and it will trigger an **Actions** workflow. This workflow will customize labels (to include emojis!) as well as Issues and Pull Request templates for your project.
