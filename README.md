# A Practical Workflow for Data Science Projects

This project is intended as a template structure for data science projects. Its main intended use is for teams within organizations but we see no reason why you would not benefit from it even if you are coding solo, participating in a data hackaton or are in a academic group, doing exploratory, statistical analysis or algorithm modelling.

(WIP: This README page will be updated with a template suited for data science projects)
